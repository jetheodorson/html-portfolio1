<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've always been into computers and gaming.<br />
  I am a landscaper/jack of all trades in my<br />
  work history. My work history also includes<br />
  6 years working at KFC! Ive built rigs before,<br />
  gaming, ect. Looking at software code 15 years<br />
  ago was an instant "not for me!" moment. I am<br />
  what you would call a blue-collar, hard working,<br />
  coder-in-training. Now that I've really made the<br />
  dive into learning the inner workings of programming<br />
  and software coding, web development is a great<br />
  introduction to coding. I really enjoy coding and<br />
  cannot wait to utilize my creative coding skills<br />
  to earn money and begin a new career I enjoy.
